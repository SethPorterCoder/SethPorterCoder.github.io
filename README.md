# CS 499 Capstone Final Project
## Seth Porter | SNHU

### Code Review
Due to the various time conflicts with my other course and my fulltime software engineering job, I was unable to commit to a thirty minute code review video.

### Project 1: Software Engineering and Design
The artifact is a C++ application. It processes a text file with one word per line and offers a menu-driven interface with four functions: 1) Count the occurrences of a user-defined word (ignoring case), 2) Show all words alongside their frequency counts, 3) Visualize word frequencies using asterisks, and 4) Exit the program. Improvements include case-insensitive search functionality, validation to ensure words contain only letters, and robust file error handling, all coded using vectors and loops to align with the original program’s structure.

I chose this artifact for my ePortfolio because it showcases a key milestone from my computer science capstone, illustrating my ability to build an interactive C++ program that handles file input and delivers clear, useful output. This project demonstrates my proficiency in file management, input validation, and structured program design—essential skills for software development. Its intuitive menu interface and enhanced features highlight my capability to produce reliable, user-friendly applications while maintaining consistency with a specified coding approach.
