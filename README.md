# CS 499 Capstone Final Project
## Seth Porter | SNHU

### Code Review
Due to the various time conflicts with my other course and my fulltime software engineering job, I was unable to commit to a thirty minute code review video.

### Project 1: Software Engineering and Design
The artifact is a C++ application. It processes a text file with one word per line and offers a menu-driven interface with four functions: 1) Count the occurrences of a user-defined word (ignoring case), 2) Show all words alongside their frequency counts, 3) Visualize word frequencies using asterisks, and 4) Exit the program. Improvements include case-insensitive search functionality, validation to ensure words contain only letters, and robust file error handling, all coded using vectors and loops to align with the original program’s structure.

I chose this artifact for my ePortfolio because it showcases a key milestone from my computer science capstone, illustrating my ability to build an interactive C++ program that handles file input and delivers clear, useful output. This project demonstrates my proficiency in file management, input validation, and structured program design—essential skills for software development. Its intuitive menu interface and enhanced features highlight my capability to produce reliable, user-friendly applications while maintaining consistency with a specified coding approach.

### Project 2: Algorithms and Data Structures
The artifact is a Python-based checkers game AI, implemented in the Checkers class using a graphics library.  It supports an interactive 8x8 checkers game for both singleplayer and multiplayer modes, though this submission focuses solely on the singleplayer functionality. The AI, driven by the CompTurn method, uses a heuristic algorithm to choose moves by prioritizing tactics like defending the back row, capturing opponent pieces, promoting pawns to kings, and ensuring safe moves. The game board is represented by a 2D list of Tile objects, with added features such as saving/loading game states and undoing moves. Enhancements include boundary checks and an undo feature to enhance reliability and user experience, while preserving the original code’s structure.

I included this checkers AI in my ePortfolio because it highlights my ability to refine algorithms and data structures within a game-based framework. This artifact showcases sophisticated algorithmic decision-making and efficient use of data structures, skills essential for effective software development.
